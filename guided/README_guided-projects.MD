# Guided Projects

A "learn by doing" initiative; taking inspiration from other people's projects to learn programming concepts. Might modify some aspects to suit own needs & working styles. Data used for all files is stored in the 'data' folder

#### Project 1: Rock or Mine Prediction ([Siddhardhan](https://www.youtube.com/c/Siddhardhan))
- An end-to-end ML project building a prediction system in Python that uses a Logistic Regression Model to detect whether a submarine is passing over a rock or mine
- Data: sonar_data.csv

#### Project 2: Diabetes Prediction ([Siddhardhan](https://www.youtube.com/c/Siddhardhan))
- An end-to-end ML project building a prediction system in Python that uses a Support Vector Machine model to predict whether a person has diabetes or not
- Data: diabetes_data.csv

#### Project 3: House Price Prediction ([Siddhardhan](https://www.youtube.com/c/Siddhardhan))
- An end-to-end ML project building a prediction system in Python that uses a XGBoost Regressor model to predict house prices
- Data: housing_data.csv

#### Project 3: Fake News Prediction ([Siddhardhan](https://www.youtube.com/c/Siddhardhan))
- An end-to-end ML project building a prediction system in Python that uses a Logistic Regression model to detect whether a piece of news is fake or not
- Data: news_data.csv
