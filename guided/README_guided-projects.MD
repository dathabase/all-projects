# Guided Projects

A "learn by doing" initiative; taking inspiration from other people's projects to learn programming concepts. Might modify some aspects to suit own needs & working styles. Data used for all files is stored in the 'data' folder

#### Project 1: Rock or Mine Prediction ([Siddhardhan](https://www.youtube.com/c/Siddhardhan))
- An end-to-end ML project building a prediction system in Python that uses a Logistic Regression Model to detect whether a submarine is passing over a rock or mine
- Data: sonar_data.csv

#### Project 2: Diabetes Prediction ([Siddhardhan](https://www.youtube.com/c/Siddhardhan))
- An end-to-end ML project building a prediction system in Python that uses a Support Vector Machine model to predict whether a person has diabetes or not
- Data: diabetes_data.csv

#### Project 3: House Price Prediction ([Siddhardhan](https://www.youtube.com/c/Siddhardhan))
- An end-to-end ML project building a prediction system in Python that uses a XGBoost Regressor model to predict house prices
- Data: housing_data.csv

#### Project 4: Fake News Prediction ([Siddhardhan](https://www.youtube.com/c/Siddhardhan))
- An end-to-end ML project building a prediction system in Python that uses a Logistic Regression model to detect whether a piece of news is fake or not
- Data: news_data.csv

#### Project 5: Loan Status Prediction ([Siddhardhan](https://www.youtube.com/c/Siddhardhan))
- An end-to-end ML project building a prediction system in Python that uses a Support Vector Machine model to check loan eligibility of a person based on his/her personal information (gender, age, income, employment, location, etc)
- Data: loan_data.csv

#### Project 6: Wine Quality Prediction ([Siddhardhan](https://www.youtube.com/c/Siddhardhan))
- An end-to-end ML project building a prediction system in Python that uses a Random Forest Classifier model to predict the quality of wine based upon its physiochemical content such as fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, sulphates, alcohol; and properties such as density and pH.
- Data: wine_quality_data.csv
